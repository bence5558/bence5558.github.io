        <p> 
            Peter Molnár Molinaro is a Hungarian painter and graphic designer. In 1978, he <br>
            started studying art at the prestigious Hungarian “Kisképző” Secondary School <br>
            of Visual Arts, training school for the Hungarian University of Fine Arts. He <br>
            continued his studies in America, graduating from high school and enrolling at <br>
            the College of Maryland, where he continued his art studies. After returning <br>
            home, he attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts, now called MOME, <br>
            majoring in applied graphics and graduating in 1987. <br>
            He continued to paint, and his works were featured in several exhibitions. <br>
            He became a graphic designer, working for a number of different companies <br>
            for over 35 years. <br>
            <br>
            Five years ago, he turned even more strongly towards painting in his creative <br>
            art. He continued his creative journey with drawing and then finally he returned <br>
            to paintings. Pointillism appeared in his painting style, with which he managed <br>
            to create a very colorful inner world. The restart period was a big journey <br>
            for him. Egyptian motifs, eyes, and shapes often came to life in his works. In his <br>
            drawings, the oval faces that characterized his very first creative period <br>
            returned. He developed a "coppercut-like" style that he liked. In these, the <br>
            representation of the landscape was given a prominent place, and later he <br>
            refined this technique even further in portrait representations. <br>
            <br>
            In his current creative period, his paintings are created from "lines". He uses this <br>
            technique to bring his paintings to life not only on paper, but also on canvas. <br>
            The meeting of dots and commas is, in fact, a contemporary, post-impressionist <br>
            world, a cavalcade of colors, which he creates with the tools of pointillism and <br>
            classical post-impressionism. <br>
            Every picture is a journey, in all the shades of colors. <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            "When I draw, it's like I'm painting and when I paint it's like I'm drawing," says <br>
            the artist about his art. <br>
